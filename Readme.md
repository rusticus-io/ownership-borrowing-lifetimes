# Workshop on Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes

Dear Rusticeans,

I'd like to show you that it doesn't take a lifetime to understand lifetimes in Rust.

This workshop provides you with a mental model to handle all of the beginners questions
and obstacles when you start out learning Rust.

You just need a solid understanding of the Stack and the Heap concepts as an entry
point to Rust. The mechanics of the former is key on you learning path.

To achieve this, we need to step back from the steep learning curve and take pen and paper into
our hands. Prepared with this knowledge the learning curve is much easier to master and
you will see that all following topics have a foundation in this basic ideas.

This workshop took place on May, 15th 2019 in Stuttgart.

I'm currently preparing an explanatory video to show more precisely my thoughts on this topic.

I will announce this video on twitter (@rustlang + #rustlang).

Yours,

Romeo
